# Uncommon HTML Bugs and Their Solutions

This repository showcases several uncommon bugs that can occur in HTML code, along with their solutions.

The `bug.html` file contains HTML code with several subtle errors.  The `bugSolution.html` file provides corrected versions of the code, demonstrating how to avoid these pitfalls.

The bugs demonstrated include:

*   Attempting to access a non-existent attribute using `getAttribute()`
*   Incorrect use of the `getAttribute` method
*   Missing event handling function within an event listener
*   Missing closing tags which leads to a parsing error

By studying these examples, developers can improve their understanding of common HTML pitfalls and write cleaner, more robust code.
